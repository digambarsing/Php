PHP Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions. You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In PHP we have the following conditional statements:

if statement - executes some code if one condition is true
if...else statement - executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false
if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions
switch statement - selects one of many blocks of code to be executed

// use of  if statement
$t = 25;

if ($t < "122") {
  echo "Have a good day!";
}


//PHP - The if...else Statement
//The if...else statement executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.
$t = 25;

if ($t < "22") {
  echo "Have a good day!";
}
else{
echo "Have a bad day!";}
//PHP - The if...elseif...else Statement
$t = 20;

if ($t > "22") {
  echo "Have a good day!";
}
elseif($t=="22"){
echo "Have a bad day!";
}
else{
echo "Have a very bad day!";}

/* The PHP switch Statement
Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed*/
$favcolor = "black";

switch ($favcolor) {
  case "red":
    echo "Your favorite color is red!";
    break;
  case "blue":
    echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
    break;
  case "green":
    echo "Your favorite color is green!";
    break;
  default:
    echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
}
PHP Loops
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.

Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.

In PHP, we have the following loop types:

while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array

 // while loop of php
$x = 1;
 
while($x <= 5) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
} 
$x =15;
$y = 10;
 
while($x >$y) {
  echo "The number is: $y <br>";
  $y++;
} 
// for loop of php
for ($x = 0; $x <= 100; $x+=10) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
}
$x=0;
for (; $x <= 100; ) {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x+=1;
}

/*The PHP do...while Loop
The do...while loop will always execute the block of code once, it will then check the condition, and repeat the loop while the specified condition is true.
Note: In a do...while loop the condition is tested AFTER executing the statements within the loop. This means that the do...while loop will execute its statements at least once, even if the condition is false. See example below.

*/
$x = 1;

do {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
} while ($x <= 0);
